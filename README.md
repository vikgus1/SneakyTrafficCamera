# SneakyTrafficCamera
This repo holds a traffic camera implementation that uses a single web cam to estimate the speed of a car passing by on a street in the camera's field of view. The speed limit of the street is configurable and a local database is kept of the license plate numbers of the cars that exceed the speed limit.
